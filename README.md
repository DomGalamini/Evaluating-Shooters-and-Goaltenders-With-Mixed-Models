# Evaluating-Shooters-and-Goaltenders-With-Mixed-Models

For my generalized linear models mini-project, I decided to use a mixed logistic regression to sniff out the NHL's most talented shooters and goaltenders. The simplicity of the model allows for an interesting way to contextualize shooting/goaltending skill in terms of distance. The talent estimates also include measures of uncertainty!!! :D
